# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple command-line tic-tac-toe game. When the programs invoked, allow the player to choose either to be X or O and then run through a game letting the user play against the computer. When it is the user's turn, you must display the current state of the board and give the user a choice of which square to play next. The game must stop when one player wins or when the board is full. 

To run the program follow the directions below:

- `git clone https://github.com/curatingbits/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`
- `cd Tic-Tac-Toe`
- `ruby bin/ttt.rb`

Good luck!
